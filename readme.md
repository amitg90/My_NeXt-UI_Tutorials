# NEXT-UI tutorial #

I decided to put here some NeXt-UI tutorials because I loved this visualization library.

The reasons why I love it is because it is :

- Powerful
- Efficient
- Easy to learn

And the last point is probably the main point which differentiate it from other libraries like D3.JS ( I love it as well ).

Let me summarize what I'm looking for.

I want a visualization javascript library which : 

- is very easy to install 
- Allow me to draw dynamic network diagrams, but not only, I would say any interaction diagrams , workflows, 
- With icons which I can connect together with the capability to change Icon and link colors
- Allows me to use any kind of custom icons
- Which allows me to click on icons and links and do something
- Which can draw dynamic diagrams from either live computed data, or from data stored into a Database

I need this, for network drawing, datavisualization, threat hunting, mind mapping... and everything I want to draw and with which I want to interact

NeXt-UI does all this and much more !

And Very quickly without spending hours to learn how to master it.

There are not a lot of Next-UI tutorials available.  I decided to publish mine in order to complete existing ones.
